# Skull-King
## Skull-King is an awesome 2 player card game that can be run on Windows platform. It has been written by QT-Framework and C++ language. This game is our AP-Project.
#### Skull King is a trick taking strategy card game where players will attempt to take the number of tricks they bid and earn points over a total of 7 rounds. If a player makes their bid they'll earn points, if they miss their bid they'll lose points. The player with the most points at the end of the 7 rounds wins! I hope you enjoy this game.
#### Note : This program is by no means an official implementation of Skull King!
